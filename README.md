# Landslide-Prevention-and-Innovation-Challenge
The main problem here is that, the common practice of identifying landslides is visual interpretation which, however, is labor-intensive and time-consuming. The use of AI will help training of model by various algorithms overtime to learn from database, and predict accurately if landslide will occur or not.
Also, most of the information comes from news reports, and there are a lot of missing events. In order to better predict landslide occurrences, the possibility of using AI is much likely to occur, since rainfall-induced landslides are a huge risk for people who live in mountainous areas.

##Objective
The main objective of this project is to automate landslide identification process using artificial intelligence techniques and classify if a landslide will occur or not.
